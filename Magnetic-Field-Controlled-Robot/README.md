### Software Features
Base Functionality: 
	Robot:
-	Constantly reads commands wireless using a pair of inductors via magnetic field from the remote control 
-	The command encoding system is one-hot to minimize the delay between movement and trigger on the remote by prioritizing the most used commands to be the shortest  
-	The one-hot encoding system supports the following seven commands:
  -	Turn left
  -	Turn right
  -	Go forward
  -	Backward
  -	Switch mode 
-	Once in automatic/tracking mode, the robot is able to adjust its relative position and angle with respect to the controller 
-	The electromagnetic signal is operated at a constant frequency of 16.275kHz
-	Both the robot and the remote control are coded using the C programming language 
Remote Controller:
- The controller transmits one-hot commands via magnetic field mentioned above
- Generates a sinusoidal wave at a frequency of 16.275kHz
-	Sends the following one-hot command when triggered:
  -	Turn left
  -	Turn right
  -	Go forward
  -	Backward
  -	Switch mode
